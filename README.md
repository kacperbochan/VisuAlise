# Visualise
## Summary
Visualise is a project allowing user to add character and locations, generate their images using **Stable Diffusion**, for later use inside **Renpy** to create visualisation.

The project is still being developed and future functions like **LLM** extracting characters and locations from text are in the works

## Current functionalities
### 1. Project management
When first starting, user sees the project window allowing them to add a new project or later select an existing one.

### 2. Text addition (for future LLM extraction)
Here the user may add a text that will be in the future used by LLM but currently will only be displayed in Builder as a story reminder.

### 3. Character/Location management
This section allows user to view existing characters/locations. It further allows the user to copy, delete or merge them.

It also allows the user to create new characters/locations.

Here is the merge screen (combining two characters/locations into one)

### 4. Specific Character/Location management
Here the user may view the existing character/location data.

Create, edit and delete versions of the characters/locations (for future **img2img** functionality)

View the gallery and assign images to versions.

The user may also show full size image along with prompt used to generate it.

It should be noted that in case of characters the user can switch and see their images without background.

### 5. Image generation
Here the user may select character or location version to be generated (they will be saved there). The interface follows typical Image generation UI.

*In the future Img2Img will be added here*

### 6. Visualisation Builder
In this place the user can orchestrate how the story goes by adding story blocks. They decide what shows, what hides and who says what.

## Future plans
The project is currently a prototype. In the future additional functionalities will be added. 
### 1. LLM 
Currently I am working on adding LLM data extraction to the project.  When completed it will finish the intended project core functionalities.
### 2. Ease of set up 
I plan on making it easier to be set up currently it requires some external file locations. 
### 3. Ergonomic design
I will work on adding more ergonomic design in places like the builder. Where I would like it to be easier to find things to change, potentially by adding the visualization to the UI, and adding chapters, and bookmarks.
Probably add some better ways to manage versions. Allowing users to extract and characters, and locations to use between projects. 

### 4. Music and voice generation
I intend to add background music and voices generation to make the story telling more immersive.
